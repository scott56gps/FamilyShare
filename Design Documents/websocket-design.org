* Websocket Design
  The FamilyShare application shall be able to make HTTP requests.
  The FamilyShare application shall update its data whenever another client modifies data.

** Available Ancestors

   1. The user starts up the application:
      - The applicaiton issues a GET request to the server to get the list of available ancestors.
      - The list of available ancestors is updated for this client.
   
   2. Another client shares a name:
      - The server broadcasts the updated changes to all clients.
